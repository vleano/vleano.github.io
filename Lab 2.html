        <p> Hi! My name is vince, and I am a student here at CSI college. Currently
            a junior studying computer science. I am part of the computer science club, working on projects,
            and I like to work with others. Working with others has brought me a lot of experience and connections
            in the computer science field. Computer science is constantly changing which keeps me motivated to learn
            different programming languages, and more motivation to work on more exciting projects. </p>
